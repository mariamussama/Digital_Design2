run and build instructions(console & GUI) :

1- to run a certain text, make sure to include the path of the text in the main section
2- the first line should include:
    - number of cells
    - number of connections
    - number of rows
    - number of columns

    - number of components in the net
    - the components' numbers

* Two placemnets will be shown on the console : 
    the initial one followed by the total wire length
    the final placemnet followed by the final total wire length

* To view the new wire placement on the GUI:
    simply run the updated annealing.py file and build using the 
    same instructions as the console. A GUI will appear with the 
    new placement and the new total wire length
